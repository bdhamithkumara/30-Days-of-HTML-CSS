Marquee Element
In this lab you have to create a marquee element using CSS, which would make the text scroll from right to left.

The default Marquee Tag in HTML has been deprecated. Even though the marquee tag is no longer recommended to use according the web standards, for backwards compatability, it is still supported in most web browsers.

However, for this lab, you would be using CSS to recreate the marquee animation.

Note:
This is a self assessed lab. There are no test cases available for this exercise lab. You would have to manually check the challenges when you're done.
