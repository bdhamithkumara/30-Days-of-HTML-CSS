Instructor SideBar
In this lab, you are tasked to re-create the codedamn's Instructor sidebar. You would have to fix it to the left of your screen & use the appropriate colors for the task. The required font is already imported for you.

You would have to copy/paste the icons instead of importing them as files into the html files.

NOTE: This is a self assessed lab. There are no test cases available for this exercise lab. You would have to manually check the challenges when you're done.
